# # PCA on a single fUSI recording
#
# This example shows how to use principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose a fUSI
# recording into principal axes of variance.
#
# PCA finds an ordered orthogonal set of axes in feature space[^1] such that projection
# onto the first *k* axes captures the maximum possible variance among all
# *k*-dimensional linear projections. Equivalently, these axes are the dominant
# eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, or of the correlation matrix if variables are
# properly standardized. If you are interested in linear covariance structure in your
# fUSI data, PCA is a useful place to start.

# ## Load a fUSI recording
#
# To demonstrate the use of PCA on fUSI data, we use a spontaneous activity recording
# from the [Nunez-Elizalde 2022 dataset](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.02.012).
# See [`fetch_nunez_elizalde_2022`][confusius.datasets.fetch_nunez_elizalde_2022] for
# more details on how to download this dataset using ConfUSIus.

# ## Correct for brain motion
#
# This recording contains some brain motion, which we can mitigate by performing a rigid
# translation correction with
# [`register_volumewise`][confusius.registration.register_volumewise]. This is a common
# preprocessing step for fUSI data, and it can help avoid spurious components driven by
# brain motion.
#
# You may set `show_progress=True` to display a progress bar during registration, which
# can be helpful for long recordings.

# %%
# The `learning_rate` controls the step size of the optimization. A value of 1e-2 is
# a common default that balances convergence speed and stability for typical fUSI data.

# ## Fit a PCA model
#
# Before performing PCA, we standardize the recording by centering and scaling each
# voxel's time series to zero mean and unit variance. The
# [`standardize`][confusius.signal.standardize] function can be used for this purpose.
# This ensures that PCA captures patterns of correlation rather than patterns of
# covariance; otherwise, PCA may be dominated by high-variance voxels, such as those
# near large blood vessels, which may not be of primary interest.

# %%
data_std = standardize(data)

# In ConfUSIus, the [`PCA`][confusius.decomposition.PCA] model wraps the familiar
# scikit-learn [`PCA`][sklearn.decomposition.PCA] model while preserving the
# fUSI DataArray metadata and coordinates. [`PCA`][confusius.decomposition.PCA] expects
# the same arguments as the scikit-learn model, such as
# [`n_components`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.fit(n_components)]] for the number of
# principal components to compute, and
# [`random_state`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.fit(random_state)] for reproducibility
# (see the API documentation for more details). After fitting the model, the principal
# axes—also known as spatial components—are stored in the
# [`.maps_`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.maps_] attribute, and the corresponding time
# series—also known as temporal components or scores—can be obtained by transforming the
# data with the [`.transform`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.transform] method.
#
# Here, we fit a PCA model with all available components.

# ## Explained variance
#
# [`explained_variance_ratio_`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.explained_variance_ratio_]
# gives the fraction of total variance captured along each selected principal axis. For
# centered data with shape `(time, space)`, the rank is at most `min(space, time - 1)`,
# so a final near-zero entry appears in the spectrum; we omit it here for clarity. The
# scree plot on the left highlights the rapid decay of successive components, while the
# cumulative curve on the right shows how quickly the total explained variance saturates.
# These plots can help guide the choice of how many components to retain for further
# analysis, for example by selecting the "elbow" of the screen plot or a threshold for
# cumulative variance.

# ## Visualize the principal axes of variance
#
# [`maps_`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.maps_] is a `(component, z, y, x)` DataArray.
# Each map is a principal axis in voxel space and indicates how strongly each voxel
# contributes to the corresponding component. Voxels with large positive weights tend to
# increase together along that axis, whereas voxels with large negative weights tend to
# vary in the opposite direction.
#
# These maps should not be interpreted as localized activation maps. Instead, they
# describe distributed patterns of covariation across the recording. In practice, the
# leading components often reflect broad anatomical or vascular structure, global signal
# fluctuations, artifacts, and other dominant sources of shared variance.

# ## Visualize the temporal components
#
# [`.transform`][confusius.decomposition.PCA.transform] returned the principal
# components, that is, the projection of the data onto each principal axis: a `(time,
# component)` DataArray. These time courses show how strongly each spatial pattern is
# expressed at each time point.
#
# Looking at the temporal scores together with the spatial maps is often more informative
# than inspecting either alone. A component may appear anatomically structured in space,
# while its score can reveal whether it reflects a slow drift, a transient fluctuation,
# or a more rhythmic pattern. Because PCA orders components by explained variance, the
# first components correspond to the most dominant temporal structure in the recording.
