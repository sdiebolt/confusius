# # Registering two acquisitions
#
# This example shows how to align two power Doppler volumes acquired from the same
# animal in different sessions. We use
# [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] with an affine transform,
# which is appropriate when the imaged anatomy is the same but the probe placement
# differs slightly between the two recordings.
#
# We pick two acquisitions from the Nunez-Elizalde 2022 dataset: subject `CR020`,
# slice `slice03`, task `spontaneous`, recorded two days apart (sessions `20191120`
# and `20191122`).

# ## Inspect the misalignment before registration
#
# The two volumes share anatomy but live on slightly different grids because the
# probe was re-positioned between sessions. We first put `moving` on the `fixed`
# grid with an identity transform via
# [`resample_like`][confusius.registration.resample_like]; any remaining mismatch is
# what `register_volume` will correct.
#
# To visualise the alignment we use confusius's
# [`plot_volume`][confusius.plotting.plot_volume] to draw the fixed image, then
# [`add_volume`][confusius.plotting.VolumePlotter.add_volume] to overlay the moving
# image with a translucent contrasting colormap. Overlapping anatomy renders as a
# blended purple; the red/blue fringe reveals the displacement we want to correct.

# ## Run the registration
#
# An affine transform captures the rotation, translation, scaling and shear difference
# between the two sessions. [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume]
# returns three values:
#
# 1. the moving image (only aligned to the fixed grid if `resample=True` is used);
# 2. the affine matrix that maps fixed-physical coordinates to moving-physical coordinates;
# 3. a [`RegistrationDiagnostics`][confusius.registration.RegistrationDiagnostics]
#    dataclass holding the per-iteration metric values and the optimizer stop
#    condition, which we use below to plot the convergence curve.
#
# !!! warning "Registration is sensitive to its arguments"
#     The result depends heavily on the choice of `transform_type`, `metric`,
#     `learning_rate`, `number_of_iterations`, `convergence_window_size`,
#     `centering_initialization`, and the multi-resolution settings
#     (`use_multi_resolution`, `shrink_factors`, `smoothing_sigmas`). The default
#     values used in this example were empirically found to work well in most
#     cases, but you should definitely try different arguments if the result is
#     not satisfactory — inspect the
#     [`RegistrationDiagnostics`][confusius.registration.RegistrationDiagnostics]
#     convergence curve and the post-registration overlay, and sweep these
#     arguments until you get a stable, well-converged result.

# !!! tip "Watch registration progress live"
#     Pass `show_progress=True` to
#     [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] to follow the
#     optimization in real time. A live matplotlib window opens during the call and
#     updates at every iteration with both the similarity-metric curve and a
#     fixed/moving composite overlay. It is the fastest way to tell whether the
#     optimizer is making progress, stuck in a local minimum, or diverging — and to
#     decide which arguments to tweak from the warning above.

# ## Inspect convergence with the registration diagnostics
#
# `diagnostics.metric_values` holds the optimizer's similarity-metric value at each
# iteration. With the default `metric="correlation"`, SimpleITK minimizes the negative
# normalized cross-correlation, so a lower (more negative) value means a better fit.
# The curve typically drops sharply at the start and then plateaus.

# The resulting affine encodes the registration transform in physical (millimeter)

# volumes from the same session with
