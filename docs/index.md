# Welcome to ConfUSIus

ConfUSIus is a Python package and napari plugin for handling, visualization,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis of functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) data.

!!! warning "Pre-Alpha Status"
    ConfUSIus is currently in **pre-alpha** and under **active development**. 
    The API is subject to change, and features may be incomplete or unstable.
    Use at your own risk.

## Features

!!! info "Design Philosophy"
    ConfUSIus is not designed as an out-of-the-box, end-to-end fUSI analysis pipeline.
    Because the fUSI field has not yet converged on standard processing workflows,
    ConfUSIus instead aims to provide the fundamental building blocks needed to implement
    any processing workflow described in the fUSI literature, or to design entirely new
    ones. Researchers can combine these blocks to build analysis pipelines suited to
    their experimental needs.

- **I/O Operations**: Load and save fUSI data in various formats (AUTC, EchoFrame,
  Iconeus SCAN, NIfTI, Zarr, etc.)
- **Beamformed IQ Processing**: Process raw beamformed IQ signals into power Doppler,
  velocity, and other derived metrics.
- **Quality Control**: Compute quality metrics (DVARS, tSNR, CV) to assess data quality.
- **Registration**: Motion correction and spatial alignment tools.
- **Brain Atlas Integration**: Map fUSI data to standard brain atlases for region-based
  analysis.
- **Signal Extraction**: Extract and reconstruct signals from regions of interest using
  spatial masks.
- **Signal Processing**: Denoising, filtering, detrending, and confound regression for
  hemodynamic signals.
- **Visualization**: Rich plotting utilities for fUSI data exploration.
- **Napari Plugin**: Interactive data loading, live time-series inspection, and quality
  control directly in the napari viewer—no scripting required.
- **Xarray Integration**: Seamless integration with Xarray for labeled multi-dimensional
  arrays.

## Installation

```bash
pip install confusius
```

Or with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv add confusius
```

See the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for detailed instructions.

## Quick Start

```python
import confusius as cf

# Load fUSI data.
data = cf.load("path/to/data.nii.gz")

# Perform motion correction.
corrected_data = data.fusi.register.volumewise()

# Visualize with napari.
corrected_data.fusi.plot()
```
