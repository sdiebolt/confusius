# Spatial Conventions

ConfUSIus works with three kinds of coordinate systems:

- the **voxel space**, linked to the underlying array storage and indexed by integer
  voxel coordinates,
- the **physical space** embedded in every DataArray's coordinates,
- and any number of **world spaces** (atlas, scanner, etc.) linked to the physical space
  through affine transforms stored in `attrs["affines"]`.

Understanding these three spaces and the axis-ordering convention used throughout
ConfUSIus makes it much easier to reason about I/O, registration, and downstream
statistical analysis.

## Axis Ordering: `(time, z, y, x)`

Every ConfUSIus DataArray that represents a fUSI recording uses the dimension order
`(time, z, y, x)`, where:

| Dimension | Physical axis | Typical size |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | Acquisition time | Thousands |
| `z` | Elevation (stacking direction) | 1 for 2D acquisitions |
| `y` | Axial / depth | Tens to hundreds |
| `x` | Lateral | Tens to hundreds |

!!! tip "Dimension ordering is mostly transparent in Xarray"
    Users familiar with neuroimaging may be more accustomed to spatiotemporal
    conventions like `(x, y, z, t)`. Thankfully, Xarray makes dimension ordering largely
    transparent in practice: you can always refer to dimensions by name and in any
    order (e.g. `data.mean("time")`, `data.sel(x=4.54, y=-2.48, z=0.0)`) rather than by
    axis index, so you won't have to remember the order of the dimensions.

This ordering is motivated by several considerations.

- **Equivalence with NIfTI:** NIfTI stores arrays in column-major (Fortran) order as
  `(x, y, z, time)`. Transposing to the more Pythonic row-major (C) order is a zero-copy
  operation that yields `(time, z, y, x)`.
- **Memory layout for volume-wise processing:** In row-major order the last axes are
  contiguous in memory, so `data[t]`—a single spatial volume—is a contiguous block,
  which is the natural unit of work for IQ processing, motion correction, and similar
  operations.
- **Statistical analysis convention:** After spatial processing, fUSI data is typically
  reshaped to `(time, voxels)` for GLMs and dimensionality reduction. This is
  `data.stack(voxels=["z", "y", "x"])` in Xarray, matching the standard
  `(samples, features)` convention of
  [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and
  [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).
- **Alignment with neuroanatomical atlases:** For coronal preclinical fUSI,
  `(z, y, x) = (elevation, axial/depth, lateral)` maps to
  `(antero-posterior, superior-inferior, left-right)`, sharing the first two axes with
  [BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info) atlases (e.g. Allen CCFv3). The physical →
  world affine captures any remaining orientation difference (e.g. a lateral mirror).
- **Visualization:** Most visualization tools (e.g. Napari) expect the last two axes to
  be the display axes of a 2D image. `data.sel(time=t, z=z)` yields a `(y, x)` array
  that plots correctly without transposing.

## Coordinate Systems

### Voxel Space

Voxel space has its origin at voxel `(0, 0, 0)` and integer indices along each
spatial axis. It is the natural indexing space of the underlying array: DataArrays can
be indexed in voxel space using the standard Xarray integer-location indexer (`.isel`).

### Physical Space

The physical space is the coordinate system embedded in the DataArray's dimension
coordinates. Its axes are `(z, y, x)` corresponding to `(elevation, axial/depth,
lateral)`. The unit of the coordinates is determined by the `units` attribute of each
coordinate array and is not fixed by ConfUSIus — millimeters are typical for fUSI, but
any consistent unit can be used.

The origin is typically the center of the probe surface, but users are free to define
any physical space they find convenient. What matters is that the coordinate values
are internally consistent and carry a meaningful physical scale.

Physical coordinates are set at data-loading time and depend on the source format:

- **EchoFrame**: Lateral and axial coordinates are read from the acquisition metadata
  file.
- **AUTC**: Lateral and axial coordinates are supplied by the user as parameters to the
  conversion function. If coordinates are omitted, ConfUSIus falls back to bare voxel
  indices and emits a warning.
- **Iconeus SCAN**: Coordinates are derived from the `voxelsToProbe` affine embedded in
  the SCAN file. The axial coordinate (`y`) is sign-flipped so that it is always
  positive and increases with depth.
- **NIfTI**: Coordinates are derived from the translation and scale components of the
  "best" affine transformation found in the file header.
- **Hand-constructed DataArrays**: The physical space is whatever the user assigns to
  the dimension coordinates.

!!! tip "The "best" NIfTI affine"
    NIfTI files can store two affine transforms in their header: an `sform` and a
    `qform`, each with an associated integer code indicating whether the affine is
    valid (`code > 0`) and which space it points to. ConfUSIus follows the NIfTI
    specification: if `sform_code > 0` the `sform` is used; otherwise, if
    `qform_code > 0` the `qform` is used. If both codes are zero a warning is emitted
    and coordinates fall back to a diagonal affine built from the `pixdim` field.

Each spatial coordinate also carries a `voxdim` attribute that records the native voxel
size along that dimension:

```python
da.coords["y"].attrs["voxdim"]  # native axial voxel size.
```

This is set at load time alongside the physical coordinates and is preserved through
any Xarray operation that propagates coordinate attributes. It is particularly useful
after downsampling: the coordinate values themselves reflect the new, coarser spacing,
but `voxdim` retains the original acquisition resolution. It is used wherever native
voxel dimensions are needed — for example, for aspect-ratio-correct visualization,
NIfTI export, and as a fallback when a dimension is later reduced to a single point
(e.g. after `.isel(z=0)`):

```python
da_down = da.isel(y=slice(None, None, 2), x=slice(None, None, 2))
# da_down.coords["y"].attrs["voxdim"] still holds the native voxel size.

da_slice = da_down.isel(z=0)
# da_slice.coords["z"].attrs["voxdim"] is now the only record of the z voxel size,
# since the coordinate has been collapsed to a scalar.
```

### World Spaces

World spaces are external coordinate systems defined by other tools or standards—for
example, an atlas space (Allen CCFv3), a scanner space, or a user-defined stereotactic
space.

ConfUSIus stores affine transformations between the DataArray's physical space and
any world space in `da.attrs["affines"]`, a dictionary keyed by affine name. Each
value is a `(4, 4)` homogeneous matrix in `(z, y, x)` convention that maps a
physical-space point to the corresponding world-space point:

```python
A @ [pz, py, px, 1] = [wz, wy, wx, 1]
```

where `(pz, py, px)` are the physical coordinates stored in `da.coords`.

Several loaders populate `da.attrs["affines"]` automatically:

- **NIfTI**: NIfTI files store `qform` and `sform` affines in their header that map
  voxel indices to world coordinates. [`load_nifti`][confusius.io.load_nifti] reads the
  relevant affine(s), converts them from voxel → world to physical → world form, and
  stores them under the keys `"physical_to_sform"` and/or `"physical_to_qform"`
  depending on which codes are valid in the header.
- **Iconeus SCAN**: [`load_scan`][confusius.io.load_scan] stores a
  `"physical_to_lab"` affine mapping ConfUSIus physical coordinates `(z, y, x)` to the
  Iconeus lab coordinate system. For multi-pose acquisitions (`3Dscan`, `4Dscan`),
  one affine per pose is stored, with shape `(npose, 4, 4)`.

After registration to an atlas, you would typically store the result yourself:

```python
_, affine_to_atlas = cf.registration.register_volume(moving, atlas)

da.attrs["affines"]["physical_to_atlas"] = affine_to_atlas
```

!!! question "Why physical → world, not voxel → world?"
    The standard NIfTI affine maps **voxel indices → world coordinates**. ConfUSIus
    uses a **physical → world** affine instead, for one practical reason: it is
    **invariant to slicing and downsampling**.

    A voxel → world affine encodes the origin as the world position of voxel `(0,0,0)`
    specifically. The moment you crop or subsample the DataArray—even a simple
    `.isel(y=slice(10, 50))`—voxel `(0,0,0)` is no longer in the array, and the
    affine silently points to the wrong location.

    A physical → world affine operates on the coordinate values already stored in
    `da.coords`. Those values travel with the data through any Xarray operation that
    preserves coordinates, so the affine remains valid without any adjustment.

    [`save_nifti`][confusius.io.save_nifti] reconstructs the full voxel → world NIfTI
    affine internally by combining the physical → world orientation matrix with the
    dimension coordinate origin and spacing.
