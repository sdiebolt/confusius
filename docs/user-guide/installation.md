## Verify Installation

To verify that ConfUSIus has been installed correctly, you may run the following code
snippet in a Python environment:

```

If the installation was successful, this code will print the installed version of
ConfUSIus without any errors. If you encounter an error, please open an issue on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/sdiebolt/confusius/issues/).
