    """Clean signals with detrending, filtering, confound regression, and scrubbing.

    Cleaning steps are applied in the following order, according to recommendations by
    Lindquist _et al._ (2019):

    1. Interpolate censored samples (pre-scrubbing).
    2. Detrend.
    3. Butterworth filter.
    4. Censor samples.
    5. Regress confounds.
    6. Standardize.

    This function is inspired by `nilearn.signal.clean`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : (time, ...) xarray.DataArray
        Signals to clean. Must have a ``time`` dimension. Can be any shape, e.g.,
        extracted signals ``(time, voxels)``, full 3D+t imaging data ``(time, z, y,
        x)``, or regional signals ``(time, regions)``.

        !!! warning "Chunking along time is not supported"
            The ``time`` dimension must NOT be chunked, except when using
            standardization or scrubbing only. Chunk only spatial dimensions:
            ``data.chunk({'time': -1})``.

    detrend_order : int, optional
        Polynomial order for detrending:

        - ``0``: Remove mean (constant detrending).
        - ``1``: Remove linear trend using least squares regression (default).
        - ``2+``: Remove polynomial trend of specified order.

        If not provided, no detrending is applied.
    standardize_method : {"zscore", "psc"}, optional
        Standardization method. If not provided, no standardization is applied.
    low_cutoff : float, optional
        Low cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies below this are attenuated (acts as
        high-pass filter). If not provided, no high-pass filtering is applied.
    high_cutoff : float, optional
        High cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies above this are attenuated (acts as
        low-pass filter). If not provided, no low-pass filtering is applied.
    filter_butterworth_kwargs : dict, optional
        Extra keyword arguments passed to `confusius.signal.filter_butterworth`.
    confounds : xarray.DataArray, optional
        Confound regressors with shape ``(time, n_confounds)``. When provided,
        confounds are detrended and filtered along with signals and then removed via
        regression.
    confounds : (time, n_confounds) xarray.DataArray, optional
        Confound regressors to remove. Can have shape ``(time,)`` for a single
        confound. The time dimension and coordinates must match the signals exactly. If
        not provided, no confound regression is applied.
    standardize_confounds : bool, default: True
        Whether to standardize confounds by their maximum absolute value before
        regression. This improves numerical stability while preserving constant terms.
    sample_mask : (time,) xarray.DataArray, optioanl
        Boolean sample mask indicating which timepoints to keep (``True``) vs. remove
        (``False``). Must have a ``time`` dimension matching ``signals``. If both
        `signals` and `sample_mask` have ``time`` coordinates, they must match exactly.
        If not provided, no scrubbing is applied.
    interpolate_method : {"linear", "nearest", "zero", "slinear", "quadratic", \
            "cubic", "quintic", "polynomial", "pchip", "barycentric", "krogh", \
            "akima", "makima"}, default: "linear"
        Interpolation method passed to `confusius.signal.interpolate_samples` when using
        pre-scrubbing interpolation. Ignored if `sample_mask` is not provided or if no
        detrending or filtering is applied. DataArray.interp`. Common options:

        - ``"nearest"``: Nearest-neighbor interpolation (fastest, least smooth).
        - ``"linear"``: Linear interpolation (faster, less smooth).
        - ``"cubic"``: Cubic spline interpolation (slower, smooth).

        See `xarray.DataArray.interp` for all available methods.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Cleaned signals.
