    This function filters along the ``time`` dimension and works with arrays of any
    shape, making it flexible for both extracted signals and full fUSI data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : (time, ...) xarray.DataArray
        Array to filter. Must have a ``time`` dimension. Can be any shape, e.g.,
        extracted signals ``(time, voxels)``, full 3D+t imaging data ``(time, z, y,
        x)``, or regional signals ``(time, regions)``.

        !!! warning "Chunking along time is not supported"
            The ``time`` dimension must NOT be chunked. Chunk only spatial dimensions:
            ``data.chunk({'time': -1})``.

    low_cutoff : float, optional
        Low cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies below this are attenuated (acts as
        high-pass filter). If not provided, no high-pass filtering is applied.
    high_cutoff : float, optional
        High cutoff frequency in Hz. Frequencies above this are attenuated (acts as
        low-pass filter). If not provided, no low-pass filtering is applied.
    order : int, default: 5
        Filter order. Higher orders give steeper roll-off but may be less stable.
    padtype : {"odd", "even", "constant", None}, default: "odd"
        Type of padding to use. See `scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt` for details.
        ``"odd"`` pads with odd-extension (reduces edge effects), ``"even"`` pads
        with even-extension, ``"constant"`` pads with zeros. If not provided, no
        padding is applied.
    padlen : int, optional
        Number of elements to pad at each end. If not provided, uses scipy's default:
        ``3 * (2 * n_sections + 1 - compensation)`` where ``n_sections = ceil(order/2)``.
    time_uniformity_tolerance : float or None, default: 0.01
        Maximum allowed relative range in sampling intervals, defined as
        ``(max_interval - min_interval) / median_interval``. Used to detect dropped
        volumes or irregular sampling. For example, 0.01 means intervals can vary by
        at most 1% of the median. Set to ``None`` to disable uniformity checking.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Filtered signals with same shape and coordinates as input.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If `signals` does not have a ``time`` dimension or ``time`` coordinates.
        - If both `low_cutoff` and `high_cutoff` are ``None`` (no filtering).
        - If ``high_cutoff <= low_cutoff`` for band-pass filtering.
        - If `order` is not positive.
        - If cutoff frequencies are invalid (negative or >= Nyquist frequency).
        - If insufficient timepoints for the filter order ``(needs >
          3*(2*ceil(order/2)+1))``.
        - If time sampling is non-uniform beyond `time_uniformity_tolerance`.

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses `scipy.signal.butter` with second-order sections (SOS) for numerical
      stability.
    - Uses `scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt` for zero-phase filtering (forward-backward).
    - Edge effects are handled automatically using padding.

    Examples
    --------
    Low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise:

    >>> import xarray as xr
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from confusius.signal import filter_butterworth
    >>> # Create signals with time coordinates (500 Hz sampling).
    >>> signals = xr.DataArray(

    ...     dims=["time", "voxels"],
    ...     coords={"time": np.arange(1000) / 500}
    ... )
    >>> # Keep frequencies below 0.1 Hz (sampling rate computed from time coords).
    >>> filtered = filter_butterworth(signals, high_cutoff=0.1)

    High-pass filter to remove slow drift:

    >>> # Keep frequencies above 0.01 Hz (remove lower frequencies).
    >>> filtered = filter_butterworth(signals, low_cutoff=0.01)

    Band-pass filter:

    >>> # Keep only frequencies between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz.

    ...     signals, low_cutoff=0.01, high_cutoff=0.1, order=5
