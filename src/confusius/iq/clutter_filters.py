        High cutoff frequency in Hertz, in range ``(0, fs/2)``. If provided, applies
        low-pass filtering below this frequency.
    order : int, default: 4
        Filter order. Due to forward-backward filtering, the effective order is
        doubled.

    Returns
    -------
    (time, z, y, x) numpy.ndarray
        Filtered IQ data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `block` is not 4D, if cutoff frequencies are invalid, or if both `low_cutoff`
        and `high_cutoff` are ``None``.
