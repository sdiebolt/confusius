    !!! warning

        The computation of the Gram matrix can lead to numerical instability when using
        single-precision data types. It is recommended to cast `signals` to
        double-precision before calling this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signals : (time, voxels) numpy.ndarray
        Beamformed IQ signals.
    ascending : bool, default: False
        Whether results should be sorted in ascending order of eigenvalues (lowest

        index-based filtering typically expects descending order (highest energy first).

    Returns
    -------
    eigenvalues : (min(time, voxels),) numpy.ndarray

    eigenvectors : (min(time, voxels), min(time, voxels)) numpy.ndarray
        Eigenvectors of the Gram matrix, sorted according to `ascending`.

    Notes
    -----
    The Gram matrix is computed as `signals @ signals.conj().T`. This is more
    efficient than full SVD when only the temporal correlations are needed, avoiding
    computation of the large spatial covariance matrix.

    !!! note "TODO"

        Consider implementing dimension-based optimization. The eigendecomposition
        of the Gram matrix is only more efficient when the number of spatial voxels
        is much larger than the number of time points. When time > voxels, it would
        be more efficient to compute the SVD directly on the data matrix instead of
        forming the temporal Gram matrix. Add logic to choose the optimal approach

    """Filter IQ data using a Butterworth digital filter.

    Applies a Butterworth infinite impulse response (IIR) filter using forward-backward
    filtering (`scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt`) to eliminate phase distortion. Supports
    low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filtering based on the cutoff frequency
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    block : (time, z, y, x) numpy.ndarray
        Complex beamformed IQ data, where `time` is the temporal dimension and
        `(z, y, x)` are spatial dimensions.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency in hertz.
    low_cutoff : float, optional
        Low cutoff frequency in hertz, in range `(0, fs/2)`. If provided, applies
        high-pass filtering above this frequency.
    high_cutoff : float, optional
        High cutoff frequency in hertz, in range `(0, fs/2)`. If provided, applies
        low-pass filtering below this frequency.
    order : int, default: 4
        Filter order. Due to forward-backward filtering, the effective order is
        doubled.

    Returns
    -------
    (time, z, y, x) numpy.ndarray
        Filtered IQ data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `block` is not 4D, if cutoff frequencies are invalid, or if both `low_cutoff`
        and `high_cutoff` are `None`.

    """Compute the high cutoff threshold for the cumulative-energy SVD clutter filter.

    Iterates over sliding temporal windows of an IQ acquisition and computes the
    cumulative eigenvalue spectrum for each window. The threshold is defined as the
    minimum cumulative energy at a given singular-value index across all windows,
    ensuring that the chosen cutoff does not over-filter any window.

    The result is returned as a lazy scalar [`dask.array.Array`][dask.array.Array]. Call
    [`.compute`][dask.array.Array.compute] on it to obtain the concrete `float` value
    when needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iq : (time, z, y, x) xarray.DataArray
        Complex beamformed IQ data, where `time` is the temporal dimension and
        `(z, y, x)` are spatial dimensions.
    singular_value_index : int
        Number of high-energy components to remove. Must satisfy
        `1 <= singular_value_index <= window_width - 1`.
    clutter_mask : (z, y, x) xarray.DataArray, optional
        Boolean spatial mask. Eigendecomposition is computed only from masked voxels.
        If not provided, all voxels are used.
    window_width : int, optional
        Width of the sliding temporal window, in volumes. If not provided, defaults
        to the total number of volumes.
    window_stride : int, optional
        Stride of the sliding temporal window, in volumes. If not provided, defaults
        to `window_width`.

    Returns
    -------
    dask.array.Array
        Lazy scalar array containing the minimum cumulative energy at
        `singular_value_index` across all sliding windows. Call `.compute()` to
        materialise the value. It can be passed directly as `high_cutoff` to
        [`clutter_filter_svd_from_cumulative_energy`][confusius.iq.clutter_filters.clutter_filter_svd_from_cumulative_energy]
        after computing.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `singular_value_index` is less than 1 or greater than `window_width - 1`.

    Notes
    -----
    For efficiency, this function computes the eigendecomposition of the temporal Gram
    matrix rather than full SVD of the data matrix, avoiding computation of the large
    spatial covariance matrix.

    Eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order, so the cumulative sum accumulates from
    the lowest-energy (noise/blood) component to the highest-energy (tissue/clutter)
    component. The threshold is set to the cumulative energy just *below* the top
    `singular_value_index` components, so that when used as `high_cutoff` in
    [`clutter_filter_svd_from_cumulative_energy`][confusius.iq.clutter_filters.clutter_filter_svd_from_cumulative_energy],
    exactly those `singular_value_index` high-energy (tissue/clutter) components have
    cumulative energy that exceeds the threshold and are removed.
