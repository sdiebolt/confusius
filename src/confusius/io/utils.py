    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or pathlib.Path
        Path to check validity.
    label : str, default: "path"
        Name of the variable passed to `check_path`, used in the error message.
    type : {"file", "dir"}, optional
        Type of path to check for. If ``"file"``, checks that the path is a file. If
        ``"dir"``, checks that the path is a directory. If not provided, no type check
        is performed, meaning the path may not exist.

    Returns
    -------
    pathlib.Path
        If successful, the path resolved to its full path.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `path` cannot be cast to pathlib.Path.
    ValueError
        If type is not ``None`` and the path is not of the correct type.
