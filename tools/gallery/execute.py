    Reads ``source`` with jupytext, runs all cells against a kernel launched
    from ``sys.executable`` (so the running interpreter matches the project's
    locked virtual environment), and returns the executed notebook plus the
    wall-clock time the execution took.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : pathlib.Path
        Path to a jupytext percent-format ``.py`` file.
    timeout : int, default: 600
        Per-cell timeout in seconds.

    Returns
    -------
    nb : nbformat.NotebookNode
        The notebook with outputs filled in.
    seconds : float
        Wall-clock time spent in ``client.execute``.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If a cell raises. The original exception is wrapped to attach the
        example path.
